# esri-loader
A tiny library to help load modules from either the [4.x](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) or [3.x](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/) versions of the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) in non-Dojo applications.

See below for more information on [why this library is needed](#why-is-this-needed) and how it can help improve application load performance.

**NOTE**: If you want to use the ArcGIS API in an [Ember](#ember), or Angular 1 application, you should use one of these libraries instead:
 - [ember-esri-loader](https://github.com/Esri/ember-esri-loader) - An Ember addon that wraps this library
 - [angular-esri-map](https://github.com/Esri/angular-esri-map), which is actually where the code in this library was originally extracted from

Otherwise you'll want to follow the [Install](#install) and [Usage](#usage) instructions below to use this library directly in your application.

See the [Examples](#examples) section below for links to applications that use this library.

## Install
```bash
npm install esri-loader
```

## Usage
The code snippets below show how to load ArcGIS API for JavaScript modules use them to create a map. Where you would place similar code in your application will depend on which application framework you are using. See below for [example applications](#examples).

### Loading Styles

Before you can use the ArcGIS API in your app, you'll need to load the styles. For example, if you're using the latest 4.x version (the default):

```css
/* esri styles */
@import url('https://js.arcgis.com/4.5/esri/css/main.css');
```

If you're using a specific version other than the latest 4.x:

```css
/* esri styles */
@import url('https://js.arcgis.com/3.22/esri/css/esri.css');
```

### Loading Modules from the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

Here's an example of how you could load and use the 4.x `Map` and `MapView` classes in a component to create a map (based on [this sample](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/sandbox/index.html?sample=webmap-basic)):

```js
// first, we use Dojo's loader to require the map class
esriLoader.loadModules(['esri/views/MapView', 'esri/WebMap'])
.then(([MapView, WebMap]) => {
  // then we load a web map from an id
  var webmap = new WebMap({
    portalItem: { // autocasts as new PortalItem()
      id: 'f2e9b762544945f390ca4ac3671cfa72'
    }
  });
  // and we show that map in a container w/ id #viewDiv
  var view = new MapView({
    map: webmap,
    container: 'viewDiv'
  });
})
.catch(err => {
  // handle any errors
  console.error(err);
});
```

#### Lazy Loading the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

If users may never end up visiting any map routes, you can lazy load the ArcGIS API for JavaScript the first time a user visits a route with a map. 

In the above snippet, the first time `loadModules()` is called, it will attempt to lazy load the most recent 4.x version of the ArcGIS API by calling `loadScript()` for you if the API has not already been loaded. The snippet below uses version 3.x of the ArcGIS API to create a map.

```js
// if the API hasn't already been loaded (i.e. the frist time this is run)
// loadModules() will call loadScript() and pass these options, which, 
// in this case are only needed b/c we're using v3.x instead of the latest 4.x
const options = {
  url: 'https://js.arcgis.com/3.22/'
};
esriLoader.loadModules(['esri/map'], options)
.then(([Map]) => {
  // create map with the given options at a DOM node w/ id 'mapNode'
  let map = new Map('mapNode', {
    center: [-118, 34.5],
    zoom: 8,
    basemap: 'dark-gray'
  });
})
.catch(err => {
  // handle any script or module loading errors
  console.error(err);
});
```

### Pre-loading the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

If you have good reason to believe that the user is going to transition to a map route, you may want to start pre-loading the ArcGIS API as soon as possible w/o blocking rendering, for example:

```js
// preload the ArcGIS API
// NOTE: in this case, we're not passing any options to loadScript()
// so it will default to loading the latest 4.x version of the API from the CDN
this.loadScriptPromise = esriLoader.loadScript();

// later, for example once a component has been rendered,
// you can wait for the above promise to resolve (if it hasn't already)
this.loadScriptPromise
.then(() => {
  // you can now load the map modules and create the map
})
.catch(err => {
  // handle any script loading errors
  console.error(err);
});
```

### Configuring Dojo

You can pass a [`dojoConfig`](https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/dojo_config/) option to `loadScript()` or `loadModules()` to configure Dojo before the script tag is loaded. This is useful if you want to use esri-loader to load Dojo packages that are not included in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript such as [FlareClusterLayer](https://github.com/nickcam/FlareClusterLayer).

```js
// in this case options are only needed so we can configure dojo before loading the API
const options = {
  // tell Dojo where to load other packages
  dojoConfig: {
    async: true,
    packages: [
      {
        location: '/path/to/fcl',
        name: 'fcl'
      }
    ]
  }
};
esriLoader.loadModules(['esri/map', 'fcl/FlareClusterLayer_v3'], options)
.then(([Map, FlareClusterLayer]) => {
  // you can now create a new FlareClusterLayer and add it to a new Map
})
.catch(err => {
  // handle any errors
  console.error(err);
});
```

### Using your own script tag

It is possible to use this library only to load modules (i.e. not to pre-load or lazy load the ArcGIS API), then you will need to add a `data-esri-loader` attribute to the script tag you use to load the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Example:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script src="https://js.arcgis.com/3.22/" data-esri-loader="loaded"></script>
```

## Why is this needed?

Unfortunately, you can't simply `npm install` the ArcGIS API and then `import` ArcGIS modules directly from the modules in a non-Dojo application. The only reliable way to load ArcGIS API for JavaScript modules is using Dojo's AMD loader. When using the ArcGIS API in an application built with another framework, you typically want to use the tooling and conventions of that framework instead of the Dojo build system. This library lets you do that by providing a module that you can `import` and use to dynamically inject an ArcGIS API script tag in the page and then use its Dojo loader to load only the ArcGIS API modules as needed.

[This blog post](http://tomwayson.com/2016/11/27/using-the-arcgis-api-for-javascript-in-applications-built-with-webpack/) explains in more detail how libraries like this provide a workaround to the challenges of loading ArcGIS API for JavaScript modules from bundlers like [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/).

In addition to solving the above challenges, this library can also help improve the performance of initial application load (always an challenge in web mapping applications) by enabling you to load the ArcGIS API and its modules only as they are needed. You can [pre-load the API](#pre-loading-the-arcgis-api-for-javascript) without blocking rendering, or [lazy load the API and modules](#lazy-loading-the-arcgis-api-for-javascript) only on routes that require them to render a map.

## Dependencies

This library doesn't have any external dependencies, but it expects to be run in a browser (i.e. not Node.js). Since v1.5 asynchronous functions like `loadScript()` and `loadModules()` return [`Promise`s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), so if your application has to support [browers that don't support Promise (i.e. IE)](https://caniuse.com/#search=promise) you have a few options.

If there's already a Promise implementation loaded on the page you can configure esri-loader to use that implementation. For example, in [ember-esri-loader](https://github.com/Esri/ember-esri-loader), we configure esri-loader to use the RSVP Promise implementation included with Ember.js.

```js
  init () {
    this._super(...arguments);
    // have esriLoader use Ember's RSVP promise
    esriLoader.utils.Promise = Ember.RSVP.Promise;
  },
```

Otherwise, you should consider using a [Promise polyfill](https://www.google.com/search?q=promise+polyfill), ideally [only when needed](https://philipwalton.com/articles/loading-polyfills-only-when-needed/).

Finally, for now you can still use `bootstrap()` and `dojoRequire()` which are the callback-based equivalents of the above functions. See the [v1.4.0 documentation](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader/blob/v1.4.0/README.md#usage) for how to use the callback-based API, but _keep in mind that these functions have been deprecated and will be removed at the next major release_.
