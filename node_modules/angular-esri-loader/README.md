# angular-esri-loader
This _was_ an [Angular](https://angular.io/) library to help you load [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) modules.

However, this has been deprectated. Instead, you should use the functions from the [esri-loader](https://github.com/esri/esri-loader) library directly in your application instead.

**NOTE**: for AngularJS use [angular-esri-map](https://github.com/Esri/angular-esri-map).
